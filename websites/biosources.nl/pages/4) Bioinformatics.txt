<h2>Introduction into Bioinformatics</h2>
This page is always under construction, please check out the <a href="http://www.biosources.nl/index.cgi?Page=7) Links">links section</a> for some starting points in bioinformatics research.
<h3>First some definitions</h3>
<b>Bioinformatics</b>: "Bioinformatics is the application of information technology to the field of molecular biology. Bioinformatics entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data."
<b>Computational Biology</b>: "Computational biology is an interdisciplinary field that applies techniques from computer science, applied mathematics and statistics to address biological problems"
<b>Cybernetics</b>: "Cybernetics is the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems. Cybernetics is related to control theory and systems theory."

A short history of genetics, this overview is made possible by wikipedia:

<h3>Classical genetics</h3>
1865 Gregor Mendel's paper, Experiments on Plant Hybridization.
1869 Friedrich Miescher discovers a weak acid in the nuclei of cells (DNA).
1885 Walther Flemming et al. elucidate chromosome distribution during cell division.
1889 Hugo de Vries postulates that "inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles" (genes).
1903 Walter Sutton hypothesizes that chromosomes, which segregate in a Mendelian fashion, are hereditary units.
1905 William Bateson coins the term "genetics".
1908 Hardy-Weinberg law derived.
1910 Thomas Hunt Morgan shows that genes reside on chromosomes.
1913 Alfred Sturtevant makes the first genetic map of a chromosome.
1913 Gene maps show chromosomes containing linear arranged genes.
1918 Ronald Fisher publishes "The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance"
1928 Frederick Griffith discovers that DNA from dead bacteria can be incorporated into live bacteria.
1931 Crossing over is identified as the cause of recombination.
1933 Jean Brachet shows DNA is found in chromosomes and that RNA is present in the cytoplasm of cells.
1941 Edward Lawrie Tatum and George Wells Beadle show that genes code for proteins.

<h3>The DNA era</h3>
