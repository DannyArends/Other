<h3>History</h3>
Founded after an idea of Danny Arends in 2009, biosources aims to help biologists and researchers in the life-sciences solving questions. Every person has his own specialty, and working together more difficult questions can be solved.
<h3>Current state</h3>
Currently development of the webplatform is just a call for collaboration to help develop the idea further.
