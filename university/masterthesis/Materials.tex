\subsection{Biological datasets}
Different datasets were used to benchmark analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Simulated datasets generated by R/qtl. \cite{broman03}
\item	Arabidopsis - RIL population between the arabidopsis strains: Landsberg erecta and Capeverdian islands, phenotypes: gene-expression, protein- and metabolite abundance. \cite{keurtj}
\item	Oats - F2 cross of Kanota X Ogle Oat. \cite{Oats}
\item	Rats - Backcross of 250 individuals, phenotype: Bloodpressure. \cite{Hyper}
\item	Listeria - F2 cross of 250 individuals mouse, phenotype: Listeria monocytogenes infection in the mouse. \cite{Listeria}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Programming tools/compilers}
Several tools were used to create an interface between R/qtl and the MQM algorithm. The tools used are summarized below:
All programs and scripts and plotting code used or created is available at request. It is also available at GBIC and the students personal repository http://www.github.com/DannyArends

\subsection{Cluster infrastructure}
To analyse QTL's directly from a Molgenis webenvironment, additional calculation power is needed to perform these intensive calculations. 
Because QTL calculation can take upto (or more than) 24 hours these calculations should be performed by a separate machine 
or even a parallel processing cluster. The plugin created for the Molgenis system uses an SHH tunnel to connect to a machine running a PBS job scheduler. Any machine using PBS to schedule jobs can in theory be used when the following prerequisites are met:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reachable by SHH connection using a login and password
\item installed PBS job scheduling system
\item R 2.7.0+
\item R Packages: RCurl, molgenis, R/qtl (optional: SNOW)
\end{itemize}
An example of the plugin can be found here:\\ http:$\backslash$$\backslash$gbic.target.rug.nl:8080$\backslash$xgap4clusterdemo$\backslash$\\
